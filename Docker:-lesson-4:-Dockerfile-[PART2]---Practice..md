## Introduction
Dockerizing a Python application involves** packaging the application and its dependencies into a Docker container** for easy deployment and scalability. To dockerize a Python app, start by creating a `Dockerfile`. The `Dockerfile` specifies the `base image`, **copies the necessary files, installs dependencies, and defines the command to run the app.** Build the Docker image using the Docker command line, which creates a reusable image. Finally, run the container using the built image, mapping ports if required. Docker provides a portable and isolated environment, ensuring consistent behavior across different systems and simplifying deployment.
