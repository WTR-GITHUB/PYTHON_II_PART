## Introduction
We can query a `MongoDB` database using `PyMongo` with the `find` function to get all the results satisfying the given condition and also using the `find_one` function, which will return only one result satisfying the condition.

The following is the syntax of the find and find_one:

```python
your_collection.find( {<< query >>} , { << fields>>} )
```

## Filter based on fields & conditions

For instance, you have hundreds of fields and you want to see only a few of them. You can do that by just putting all the required field names with the value `1`. For example:

```python
your_shop_collection.find_one( {}, { "week": 1, "checkout_price" : 1})
```

On the other hand, if you want to discard a few fields only from the complete document, you can put the field names equal to `0`. **Therefore, only those fields will be excluded**. Please note that you cannot use a combination of 1s and 0s to get the fields. Either all should be one, or all should be zero.

```python
your_shop_collection.find_one( {}, {"num_orders" : 0, "meal_id" : 0})
```

Now, in this section, we will provide a condition **in the first braces and fields to discard in the second**. Consequently, it will return the `first document` with `center_id` equal to `55` and `meal_id` equal to `1885` and will also discard the fields `_id` and `week`:

```python
your_shop_collection.find_one( {"center_id" : 55, "meal_id" : 1885}, {"_id" : 0, "week" : 0} )
```

## Filter based on Comparison Operators

<!--StartFragment-->

NAME | DESCRIPTION
-- | --
$eq | It will match the values that are equal to a specified value.
$gt | It will match the values that are greater than a specified value.
$gte | It will match all the values that are greater than or equal to a specified value.
$in | It will match any of the values specified in an array.
$lt | It will match all the values that are less than a specified value.
$lte | It will match all the values that are less than or equal to a specified value.
$ne | It will match all the values that are not equal to a specified value.
$nin | It will match none of the values specified in an array.

### $eq and $ne

Here are code examples for filtering `MongoDB` using `PyMongo` with the `$eq` (equals) and `$ne` (not equals) operators:

```python
from typing import List
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["your_database_name"]
collection = db["your_collection_name"]

# Filtering using $eq operator
def filter_by_equals(field_name: str, value: str) -> List[dict]:
    query = {field_name: {"$eq": value}}
    result = collection.find(query)
    return list(result)

# Example usage: Filter documents where the "age" field is equal to 25
filtered_equals = filter_by_equals("age", "25")
print(filtered_equals)


# Filtering using $ne operator
def filter_by_not_equals(field_name: str, value: str) -> List[dict]:
    query = {field_name: {"$ne": value}}
    result = collection.find(query)
    return list(result)

# Example usage: Filter documents where the "name" field is not equal to "John"
filtered_not_equals = filter_by_not_equals("name", "John")
print(filtered_not_equals)

```
In the above code:

- The `filter_by_equals` function takes a field name and a value as parameters, creates a query using the `$eq` operator, executes the query using 
  `collection.find()`, and returns a list of matching documents.
- The `filter_by_not_equals` function is similar but uses the $ne operator instead.
- The resulting documents are converted to a list using `list(result)` to make it easier to work with the results.
- The function calls demonstrate filtering by the `age` field equal to `25` and the `name` field not equal to `John`, respectively.

By encapsulating the filtering logic in functions, you can reuse the code for different fields and values as needed. Additionally, converting the query results to a list provides a concrete data structure for further processing.

### $gt and $lt
Here are code examples for filtering `MongoDB` using `PyMongo` with the `$gt` (greater than) and `$lt` (less than) operators:

```python
from typing import List
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["your_database_name"]
collection = db["your_collection_name"]

# Filtering using $gt operator
def filter_by_greater_than(field_name: str, value: int) -> List[dict]:
    query = {field_name: {"$gt": value}}
    result = collection.find(query)
    return list(result)

# Example usage: Filter documents where the "age" field is greater than 25
filtered_greater_than = filter_by_greater_than("age", 25)
print(filtered_greater_than)


# Filtering using $lt operator
def filter_by_less_than(field_name: str, value: int) -> List[dict]:
    query = {field_name: {"$lt": value}}
    result = collection.find(query)
    return list(result)

# Example usage: Filter documents where the "rating" field is less than 4.5
filtered_less_than = filter_by_less_than("rating", 4.5)
print(filtered_less_than)

```

In the above code:

- The `filter_by_greater_than` function takes a field name and a value (expected to be an integer) as parameters. It creates a query using the `$gt` 
  operator, executes the query using `collection.find()`, and returns a list of matching documents.
- The `filter_by_less_than` function is similar but uses the `$lt` operator instead.
- The resulting documents are converted to a list using `list(result)` to make it easier to work with the results.
- The function calls demonstrate filtering by the `age` field greater than `25` and the `rating` field less than `4.5`, respectively.



## Exercises: 

* Task Nr.1 :
  Create the CLI application, that would populate MongoDB database with random data. The input should ask for :
  - database name
  - collection name
  - field name with types (string, number, date string objects etc.) with range of values (lets say field name = price , then value is number (float, 
    int) which is random number from a(min) to b(max) )
  - number o documents to create.

* Task Nr.2: 
  Write a function `filter_documents` that takes a `MongoDB` collection, a field name, an equal value, and a not equal value as parameters. The function 
  should return a list of documents from the collection where the specified field is equal to the equal value and not equal to the not equal value.

* Task Nr.3:  
  With your own tool, create of database of grocery store. Store consist three different categories of items (lets say electronics, fruits, food etc.).
  The items as minimum should have these fields: name, price, quantity, year made (YYYY-MM-DD). 
  Task: 
   - Get all electronic item monetary value items made 3 years, 2 months and 12 days from today.
