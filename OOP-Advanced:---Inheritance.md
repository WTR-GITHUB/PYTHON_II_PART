## Multiple Inheritance & MRO (Method Resolution Order)

In Python, a class **can inherit from multiple superclasses**, a concept known as `multiple inheritance`. This allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple superclasses.

Here's an example of how to use multiple inheritance in Python:

```python

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name = name
    
    def make_sound(self) -> None:
        print("Some generic animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name: str, breed: str) -> None:
        super().__init__(name)
        self.breed = breed
    
    def make_sound(self) -> None:
        print("Bark")

class Cat(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name: str, fur_color: str) -> None:
        super().__init__(name)
        self.fur_color = fur_color
    
    def make_sound(self) -> None:
        print("Meow")

# Here's an example of a class that inherits from both Dog and Cat
class DogCat(Dog, Cat):
    def __init__(self, name: str, breed: str, fur_color: str) -> None:
        super().__init__(name, breed)
        Cat.__init__(self, name, fur_color)

dogcat = DogCat("Fluffy", "Poodle", "White")
print(dogcat.name)  # prints "Fluffy"
print(dogcat.breed)  # prints "Poodle"
print(dogcat.fur_color)  # prints "White"
dogcat.make_sound()  # prints "Bark"

```
In the example above, the `DogCat` class inherits from both the `Dog` and `Cat` classes. It has access to all of the attributes and methods of both of these classes. When we create an instance of DogCat, it first calls the `__init__` method of the `Dog` class with the name and breed arguments, and then it calls the `__init__` method of the `Cat` class with the `name` and `fur_color` arguments.

When we call the `make_sound` method on a `DogCat` instance, it uses the implementation of the method that is defined in the `Dog` class, since the `Dog` class is listed before the `Cat` class in the inheritance list.

Multiple inheritance can be a powerful tool, but it can also make your code more complex and harder to understand, so you should use it with caution.

### MRO - Method Resolution Order

In Python, when a class inherits from multiple superclasses, it can be ambiguous which version of an attribute or method to use. To resolve this ambiguity, Python uses a mechanism called the **method resolution order (MRO)**.

The MRO is the order in which a class's attributes and methods are inherited from its `superclasses`. It determines which implementation of an attribute or method will be used when an instance of the class calls it.

Here's an example of how the MRO works in Python:

```python

class A:
    def foo(self) -> None:
        print("A.foo")

class B(A):
    def foo(self) -> None:
        print("B.foo")

class C(A):
    def foo(self) -> None:
        print("C.foo")

class D(B, C):
    pass

d = D()
d.foo()  # prints "B.foo"

```

In the example above, the `D` class inherits from both the `B` and `C` classes. The `foo` method is defined in both the `B` and `C` classes, so it is ambiguous which one to use.

To determine the `MRO` for the `D` class, Python follows these steps:

1. It starts with the `D` class and adds it to the MRO list.
2. It looks at the first superclass of `D`, which is `B`. It adds `B` to the MRO list, and then repeats this process with `B's` superclass, `A`.
3. It looks at the second superclass of `D`, which is `C`. It adds `C` to the MRO list, and then repeats this process with `C's` superclass, `A`.
4. It removes any duplicate classes from the MRO list. In this case, it removes the second instance of `A`, since it has already been added to the list.

The resulting MRO for the `D` class is `[D, B, A, C]`. This means that when we call the foo method on an instance of `D`, it will use the implementation of the foo method that is defined in the `B` class.

You can use the `__mro__` attribute of a class to see its MRO:

```python
print(D.__mro__)  
# prints (<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.C'>)

```

## Multilevel inheritance

In Python, a class can inherit from a class that itself inherits from another class, a concept known as `multilevel inheritance`. This allows a class to _inherit attributes and methods from multiple levels of the inheritance hierarchy_.

Here's an example of how to use multilevel inheritance in Python:

```python

class A:
    def foo(self) -> None:
        print("A.foo")

class B(A):
    def bar(self) -> None:
        print("B.bar")

class C(B):
    def baz(self) -> None:
        print("C.baz")

c = C()
c.foo()  # prints "A.foo"
c.bar()  # prints "B.bar"
c.baz()  # prints "C.baz"
```
In the example above, the `C` class inherits from the `B` class, which in turn inherits from the `A` class. This creates a `multilevel inheritance` hierarchy where the `C class` **has access to all of the attributes and methods of both the B class and the A class**.

When we create an instance of `C` and call the `foo` method, it uses the implementation of the `foo` method that is defined in the `A` class. Similarly, when we call the `bar` method, it uses the implementation of the `bar` method that is defined in the `B` class. And when we call the `baz` method, it uses the implementation of the `baz` method that is defined in the `C` class

## Method Overriding

In Python, it is possible for a `subclass` to **override** the attributes and methods of its superclass. This means that the subclass can define its own implementation of an attribute or method that already exists in the superclass.

Here's an example of how to use method overriding:

```python

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, make: str, model: str) -> None:
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def start(self) -> None:
        print(f"Starting {self.make} {self.model}")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, make: str, model: str, year: int) -> None:
        super().__init__(make, model)
        self.year = year

    def start(self) -> None:
        print(f"Inserting key in {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}")
        super().start()

car = Car("Honda", "Accord", 2020)
car.start()  # prints "Inserting key in 2020 Honda Accord", "Starting Honda Accord"

```
In this example, the `Car` class inherits from the `Vehicle` class and **overrides** the `start` method. When we create an instance of `Car` and call the `start` method, it uses the implementation of the `start` method that is defined in the `Car` class, which prints a message about inserting the key in the car. It then calls the `start` method of the `Vehicle` class using the `super().start()` syntax, which prints a message about starting the vehicle.

* Task Nr.1:  

  Define a Shape class with the following attributes and methods:

  * A name attribute, which is a string that represents the name of the shape.
  * A sides attribute, which is an integer that represents the number of sides of the shape.
  * An area method, which returns the area of the shape.

  Then, define a Rectangle class that inherits from the Shape class and has the following attributes and methods:

  * A width attribute, which is a float that represents the width of the rectangle.
  * A height attribute, which is a float that represents the height of the rectangle.
  * An __init__ method that initializes the name, sides, width, and height attributes.
  * An area method that overrides the area method of the Shape class and returns the area of the rectangle.

  Finally, define a Square class that inherits from the Rectangle class and has the following attributes and methods:

  * A side_length attribute, which is a float that represents the length of the sides of the square.
  * An __init__ method that initializes the side_length attribute and calls the __init__ method of the Rectangle class to initialize the name, sides, 
  width, and height attributes.
