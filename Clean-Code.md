# PEP8

As any programming language has naming standards and standards for the ways it does certain things - Python is not an exception. With the naming standards we communicate better with other developers on what certain things must be and what they should not. It was written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.

PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and there are several of them. A PEP is a document that describes new features proposed for Python and documents aspects of Python, like design and style, for the community.

Why do we need it, simply as the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python) states: Readability counts. There are many benefits of standardizing the way people write code:
1. If you follow a certain standard it is easier for others to understand your code and the other way around.
1. Improved code readability.
1. Makes code clean.

These all sound like synonyms and of course they are, but let's see a few examples where the naming standards .

**NOTE**

Never use l, O single letter names as they might be mistakes for 1 and 0:
```python
O = 2  # This may look like you're trying to reassign 2 to zero
```
