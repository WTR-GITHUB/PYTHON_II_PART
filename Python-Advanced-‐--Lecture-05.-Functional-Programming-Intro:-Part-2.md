## `Continue`

### `Map function`

The first function on the docket is map(), which is a Python built-in function. With map(), you can apply a function to each element in an iterable in turn, and map() will return an iterator that yields the results. This can allow for some very concise code because a map() statement can often take the place of an explicit loop.

Syntax:

```python
map(<f>, <iterable>)
```

Let's revisit our function:
```python
def reverse(s):
    return s[::-1]

reverse("I am a string")
```

If you have a list of strings, then you can use map() to apply reverse() to each element of the list:


```python
animals = ["cat", "dog", "hedgehog", "gecko"]
iterator = map(reverse, animals)
iterator
# <map object at 0x7fd3558cbef0>
```


**NOTE** ‚ùó ‚ùó ‚ùó But remember, map() doesn‚Äôt return a list. It returns an iterator called a map object. To obtain the values from the iterator, you need to either iterate over it or use list():

```python
animals = ["cat", "dog", "hedgehog", "gecko"]
def reverse(s):
    return s[::-1]

iterator = map(reverse, animals)
for i in iterator:
    print(i)
# tac
# god
# gohegdeh
# okceg

iterator = map(reverse, animals)
list(iterator)

```


Let's take it further once more, we already know that lambdas give us a function, let's try passing it to map function:

```python
animals = ["cat", "dog", "hedgehog", "gecko"]
iterator = map(lambda s: s[::-1], animals)
list(iterator)
# ['tac', 'god', 'gohegdeh', 'okceg']
```

Let's even do it a more compact way:

```python
list(map(lambda s: s[::-1], ["cat", "dog", "hedgehog", "gecko"]))
# ['tac', 'god', 'gohegdeh', 'okceg']
```

If the iterable contains something that is not suitable for a certain operation:

```python
list(map(lambda s: s[::-1], ["cat", "dog", 3.14159, "gecko"]))
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
#  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <lambda>
# TypeError: 'float' object is not subscriptable
```

In this case, the lambda function expects a string argument, which it tries to slice. The second element in the list, 3.14159, is a float object, which isn‚Äôt sliceable. So a TypeError occurs.


## Calling map with multiple iterables

```python
map(<f>, <iterable‚ÇÅ>, <iterable‚ÇÇ>, ..., <iterable‚Çô>)
```

The number of <iterablei> arguments specified to map() must match the number of arguments that <f> expects. <f> acts on the first item of each <iterablei>, and that result becomes the first item that the return iterator yields. Then <f> acts on the second item in each <iterablei>, and that becomes the second yielded item, and so on.

```python
def f(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c


list(map(f, [1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30], [100, 200, 300]))
# [111, 222, 333]
```
Here is more visual representation of how the calculation is being done:

# filter function

filter() allows you to select or filter items from an iterable based on evaluation of the given function. It‚Äôs called as follows:

```python
filter(<f>, <iterable>)
```


filter(<f>, <iterable>) applies function <f> to each element of <iterable> and returns an iterator that yields all items for which <f> is truthy. Conversely, it filters out all items for which <f> is falsy.

```python
def greater_than_100(x):
    return x > 100

list(filter(greater_than_100, [1, 111, 2, 222, 3, 333]))
# [111, 222, 333]
```

As we see that function is the first argument, let's try applying lambdas function here.


```python
list(filter(lambda x: x > 100, [1, 111, 2, 222, 3, 333]))
```

What is more we can even combine there things with range() function - range(n) produces an iterator that yields the integers from 0 to n - 1. The following example uses filter() to select only the even numbers from the list and filter out the odd numbers:


```python
list(range(10))
# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

list(filter(is_even, range(10)))
# [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10)))
# [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

```

Can we do that with strings as well? As long as we have  a correct function that returns `True` or `False` based on string input - Yes!

```python
animals = ["cat", "Cat", "CAT", "dog", "Dog", "DOG", "emu", "Emu", "EMU"]

def all_caps(s):
    return s.isupper()

list(filter(all_caps, animals))
# ['CAT', 'DOG', 'EMU']

list(filter(lambda s: s.isupper(), animals))
# ['CAT', 'DOG', 'EMU']
```


# Reduce function

reduce() applies a function to the items in an iterable two at a time, progressively combining them to produce a single result.

To use reduce(), you need to import it from a module called functools. This is possible in several ways, but the following is the most straightforward:


```python
from functools import reduce
```

## Calling reduce with two arugments:

```python
reduce(<f>, <iterable>)
```

reduce(<f>, <iterable>) uses <f>, which must be a function that takes exactly two arguments, to progressively combine the elements in <iterable>. To start, reduce() invokes <f> on the first two elements of <iterable>. That result is then combined with the third element, then that result with the fourth, and so on until the list is exhausted. Then reduce() returns the final result.

let's start with some simple examples:


```python
def f(x, y):
    return x + y


from functools import reduce
reduce(f, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
# 15
```

Here is a representation of what is happening behind the scenes when `reduce` is called:

![IMG](https://github.com/CodeAcademy-Online/python-new-material-level2/blob/master/images/reduce.webp)

reduce is quite disliked function even by the python creator Guido van Rossum:

_So now reduce(). This is actually the one I‚Äôve always hated most, because, apart from a few examples involving + or *, almost every time I see a reduce() call with a non-trivial function argument, I need to grab pen and paper to diagram what‚Äôs actually being fed into that function before I understand what the reduce() is supposed to do. So in my mind, the applicability of reduce() is pretty much limited to associative operators, and in all other cases it‚Äôs better to write out the accumulation loop explicitly. ([Source](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196))_

Even in our example we can see that there are simpler ways of doing our simple example. Can you suggest any of them? Discuss

The most simple one would probably be:
```python
sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

Now let's use multiplication operator (*) to find a factorial of some number. [What is a factorial](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/factorial.html)

```python
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y


def factorial(n):
    from functools import reduce
    return reduce(multiply, range(1, n + 1))


factorial(4)  # 1 * 2 * 3 * 4

factorial(6)  # 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6
```


Yet there is a quite simpler example on how to do this:
```python
from math import factorial

factorial(4)

factorial(6)
```


We could also use reduce to get the same result as max() does:

```python
max([23, 49, 6, 32])


def greater(x, y):
    return x if x > y else y


from functools import reduce
reduce(greater, [23, 49, 6, 32])
```

## Calling reduce() with initial value

```python
reduce(<f>, <iterable>, <init>)
```

When present, <init> specifies an initial value for the combination. In the first call to <f>, the arguments are <init> and the first element of <iterable>. That result is then combined with the second element of <iterable>, and so on:
```python
def f(x, y):
    return x + y


from functools import reduce
reduce(f, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 100)  # (100 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)
```

The graphical visualization of the actions taken:


![IMG](https://github.com/CodeAcademy-Online/python-new-material-level2/blob/master/images/reduce2.webp)


As you‚Äôve seen in the above examples, even in cases where you can accomplish a task using reduce(), it‚Äôs often possible to find a more straightforward and Pythonic way to accomplish the same task without it. Maybe it‚Äôs not so hard to imagine why reduce() was removed from the core language after all.

That said, reduce() is kind of a remarkable function. The description at the beginning of this section states that reduce() combines elements to produce a single result. But that result can be a composite object like a list or a tuple. For that reason, reduce() is a very generalized higher-order function from which many other functions can be implemented.

For example, you can implement map() in terms of reduce():

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

list(map(str, numbers))


def custom_map(function, iterable):
    from functools import reduce

    return reduce(
        lambda items, value: items + [function(value)],
        iterable,
        [],
    )

print(list(custom_map(str, numbers)))
```

In fact, any operation on a sequence of objects can be expressed as a reduction.
