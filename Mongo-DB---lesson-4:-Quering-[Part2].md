###  $gte and $lte
Here are code examples for filtering MongoDB using `PyMongo` with the `$gte` (greater than or equal to) and `$lte` (less than or equal to) operators:

```python
from typing import List
from pymongo import MongoClient
from pymongo.collection import Collection

# Filtering using $gte operator
def filter_by_greater_than_equal(collection: Collection, field_name: str, value: int) -> List[dict]:
    query = {field_name: {"$gte": value}}
    result = collection.find(query)
    return list(result)

# Example usage: Filter documents where the "age" field is greater than or equal to 25
filtered_greater_than_equal = filter_by_greater_than_equal(collection, "age", 25)
print(filtered_greater_than_equal)


# Filtering using $lte operator
def filter_by_less_than_equal(collection: Collection, field_name: str, value: int) -> List[dict]:
    query = {field_name: {"$lte": value}}
    result = collection.find(query)
    return list(result)

# Example usage: Filter documents where the "rating" field is less than or equal to 4.5
filtered_less_than_equal = filter_by_less_than_equal(collection, "rating", 4.5)
print(filtered_less_than_equal)

```

In the above code:

 - The `filter_by_greater_than_equal` function takes a MongoDB collection, a field name, and a value (expected to be an integer) as parameters. It 
   creates 
   a query using the $gte operator, executes the query using collection.find(), and returns a list of matching documents.
 - The `filter_by_less_than_equal` function is similar but uses the $lte operator instead.
 - The resulting documents are converted to a list using `list(result)` to make it easier to work with the results.
 - The function calls demonstrate filtering by the "age" field greater than or equal to 25 and the "rating" field less than or equal to 4.5, 
   respectively.


###  $in and $nin
Here are code examples for filtering MongoDB using `PyMongo` with the `$in` (inclusion) and `$nin` (exclusion) operators:

```python
from typing import List
from pymongo import MongoClient
from pymongo.collection import Collection

# Filtering using $in operator
def filter_by_in(collection: Collection, field_name: str, values: List[str]) -> List[dict]:
    query = {field_name: {"$in": values}}
    result = collection.find(query)
    return list(result)

# Example usage: Filter documents where the "country" field is in a list of countries
countries = ["USA", "Canada", "UK"]
filtered_in = filter_by_in(collection, "country", countries)
print(filtered_in)


# Filtering using $nin operator
def filter_by_not_in(collection: Collection, field_name: str, values: List[str]) -> List[dict]:
    query = {field_name: {"$nin": values}}
    result = collection.find(query)
    return list(result)

# Example usage: Filter documents where the "category" field is not in a list of categories
categories = ["Sports", "Music", "Art"]
filtered_not_in = filter_by_not_in(collection, "category", categories)
print(filtered_not_in)

```

In the above code:

- The `filter_by_in` function takes a MongoDB collection, a field name, and a list of values (expected to be strings) as parameters. It creates a query 
  using the $in operator, executes the query using collection.find(), and returns a list of matching documents.
- The `filter_by_not`_in function is similar but uses the $nin operator instead.
- The resulting documents are converted to a list using


## Exercises: 

* Task Nr.1 :
  Create a simple database (type of db, collections, fields - from your mind) with your db tools and incorporate all new querying operators with the 
  results.

* Task Nr.2:
