## Dataclasses

Python's `dataclass` module is a **decorator-based approach** to creating classes that are primarily **used to store data**. It was introduced in Python 3.7 and allows you to define classes with less boilerplate code. A dataclass is a class that mainly consists of data and provides methods for accessing and manipulating this data.

Here's an example of how to use the dataclass module:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    email: str
```

In this example, we've defined a `Person` class using the `@dataclass` decorator. The class has three attributes: `name`, `age`, and `email`, each with a type hint. The `@dataclass` decorator automatically generates several special methods, such as `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`, based on the attributes defined in the class.

You can then create an instance of the Person class and access its attributes as follows:

```python
person = Person("John Doe", 30, "johndoe@example.com")
print(person.name) # Output: John Doe

```

Here's another example that demonstrates how to use the `dataclass` module to create a class representing a 2D point:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Point:
    x: float
    y: float

    def distance_from_origin(self) -> float:
        return (self.x ** 2 + self.y ** 2) ** 0.5

```

In this example, we've defined a `Point` class with two attributes: `x` and `y`, each of which is a `float`. We've also defined a method `distance_from_origin` that calculates the distance of the point from the origin.

You can then create an instance of the `Point` class and call its `distance_from_origin` method as follows:

```python
point = Point(3, 4)
print(point.distance_from_origin()) # Output: 5.0

```
Overall, Python's `dataclass` module is a useful tool for creating classes with less boilerplate code that mainly consist of data. By following good coding practices, such as using type hints and following the PEP 8 style guide, you can write clean and maintainable code that is easy to understand and modify.

### Why use `dataclasses`
There are many reasons we have an increase in programmer efficiency and code quality using `@dataclass` . Here‚Äôs a list of significant major improvements :
 - Data validation: @dataclass automatically generates methods for checking the validity of the data in a class instance. @dataclass ensures that the 
   data in a class instance is in the correct format and meets any specified constraints.
 - Improved readability: @dataclass improves understanding of the structure and purpose of a class by clearly separating the data fields from the 
   behavior.
 - Automatic generation of boilerplate code: The @dataclass decorator generates several methods, such as __init__, __repr__, and __eq__, often needed 
   when working with data classes.
 - Improved maintainability: @dataclass promote better maintenance and lower the cost of refactoring code by providing a clear separation between data 
   and behavior.
 - Improved performance: The @dataclass decorator generates methods that are optimized for performance, such as the __init__ method, which uses keyword- 
   only arguments to reduce the number of attribute lookups needed.
 - Improved compatibility with immutable data structures: Data values become immutable using the @dataclass frozen=TRUE option. We show, with an example, 
   how to transform a set of global constants into a shared package of constants.


## Exercises: 

1) You have been asked to create a simple inventory management system for a small retail store. You need to define a `Product` class using the dataclass 
   module that represents a product in the store. Each `Product` should have a unique `ID`, a `name`, a `description`, a `price`, and a `quantity in 
   stock`. You also need to implement a method `calculate_total_cost` that calculates the total cost of a given number of items of the product, taking 
   into account any discounts that may apply.

2) Create a set of data classes to model an online bookstore management system. The classes should include Author, Book, Customer, and Order. Your goal 
   is to design a system that enables the management of books, authors, customers, and orders in an online bookstore.

   Author Class:
    - Attributes: author_id (int), name (str), birth_year (int), books (List[Book]).
    - Initialize the attributes in the __init__ method.

   Book Class:
    - Attributes: book_id (int), title (str), author (Author), publication_year (int), price (float), quantity_in_stock (int).
    - Initialize the attributes in the __init__ method.
    - Add a method sell that reduces the quantity_in_stock when a book is sold.

   Customer Class:
    - Attributes: customer_id (int), name (str), email (str), orders (List[Order]).
    - Initialize the attributes in the __init__ method.
   
   Order Class:
    - Attributes: order_id (int), customer (Customer), books (List[Book]), total_price (float), status (str) - either "Pending" or "Shipped".
    - Initialize the attributes in the __init__ method.
    - Add a method calculate_total_price that calculates the total price of the order based on the books' prices and quantities.
    - Add a method ship_order that changes the order status to "Shipped" and updates the stock quantity for each book. 

3) You need to create a program to manage a list of books in a library. Each book has a `title`, an `author`, a `publication year`, and an `ISBN`. You 
   need to define a `Book` class using the `dataclass` module that contains attributes for these properties. You also need to implement a `Library` class 
   that manages a list of books. The `Library` class should allow you to `add` and `remove` books from the library, search for books by `title` or 
   `author`, and display the list of books currently in the library.
