# Debugging Python code

There are a lot of ways one can Debug Python code. You could be using an IDE extensions allowing to do that in you IDE GUI, or you can do that a bit more tedious way with pdb library:

```python
...
import pdb
pdb.set_trace()
...
``` 

Once this line is reached you will get a shell where you can look around in computers memory and see what variables you have, their state etc.

Of course as mentioned before it is indeed a bit tedious to debug the code by writing more code... So let's look how we can do this with the help of the VSCode. 

So let's create main.py file and write some code:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

for item in my_list:
    something = item + 1
    print(something + 1)
```


So this is rather simple and straightforward but how do we inspect what is _something_ during the runtime? So let's at first one the left handside of the code window add red bubble simply by clicking with our cursor:
