# Environmental variables

For now we have heard what is the virtual environment. But what are those Environmental variables and what problems do they solve?

To put simply, we can use them as a form of configuration or storing sensitive data: IPs, credentials, anything else that we do not have exposed in our git project for others to see. We could also use predefine some Environmental variables in GitHub, GitLab, etc. for automated pipelines. 

## Local environmental variables

In this section we will review how can the environmental variables can help us run our application locally. So imagine a situation where you have to connect to some external API to fetch some data. [Example](https://polygon.io/) this API has couple of tiers allowing us to do certain things. But if we paid for it,  would we want others to use it on our behalf? If the API is charged based on amount of requests - probably not. So how do we make sure that application still works, and we don't break anything along the way? 


what we could do is introduce some environmental variables simply using terminal:

```bash
export USER=USERNAME
export TOKEN=12345
```

**PRO TIP** ðŸ§  Remember that these variables are only available on the terminal that you are working on. Once you open up new terminal they are "forgotten".

Now how do we reach them once python code is running? - Simple!

```python3
import os


USER = os.getenv("USER")
TOKEN = os.getenv("TOKEN")
...
```

Try this out yourself. How can you check if this works? What others things would you like to hide from others in your repo? Discuss.

Of course if you have codebase like that it is mandatory to warn your possible users/ colleagues that these variables have to be exported before launching the application, otherwise you will be asked about this too many times.

There are also ways of setting there variables in separate configuration files, that have to be precreated manually, another option is to use some 3rd party library. One of such examples is the library that along with FastAPI gets a lot of love as well - [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) . Please check it out, here we will just show a simple example with environmental variables, but the library goes far beyond that - It's main purpose is to validate data structures, mostly json, but it is really amazing.

So getting back to our topic, how do we use thing great tool for env variables? We start by cutting out importing of os module and adding pydantic:



```python
from typing import Optional


from pydantic import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    API_V1_STR: str = "/api/v1"
    MONGODB_URL: str
    GF_API_URL: Optional[str] = None
    TOKEN_SECRET_KEY: str = (
        "09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7"
    )
```

With these variables set up in place, later on when
