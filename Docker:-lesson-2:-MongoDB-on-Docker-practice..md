## Introduction

`MongoDB` can be run in a Docker container. There is an [official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) available on `Docker Hub` containing the MongoDB community edition, used in development environments. For production, you may custom-build a container with MongoDB‚Äôs enterprise version.

If you want to use your `MongoDB` database across several machines, using Docker containers for hosting MongoDB is a great approach ‚Äì you can easily create new isolated instances. Furthermore, during development, it is easier to start a Docker instance than manually configure a server.

## Start image 

You can start a MongoDB server running the latest version of MongoDB using Docker with the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name test-mongo mongo:latest
```

This will pull the latest [official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/) from Docker Hub. Adding the -d flag will ensure that the Docker container runs as a background process, separate from the shell. The -p tag signifies the port that the container port is bound back to 27017. You can connect to MongoDB on localhost:27017.

To change the port number, you can change the -p flag argument to 8000:27017 to use localhost:8000. You can also use the --port flag to mention the port. Using the latest image helps you avoid version bumps. Execute this to run MongoDB on port 8000:

```
docker run -d --name test-mongo mongo:latest --port 8000
```
Or choose your own port:

```
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name example-mongo mongo:latest
```

Alternatively, if you pulled the image specifying a version tag, run the Docker container with this command:

```
docker run -d --name test-mongo mongo:4.0.4
```

## Manage database within a container: 

Use the following command to open the MongoDB shell:

```
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_NAME> bash
```

Enter mongo shell by typing: 

```
mongosh
```

### Commands 

```
show dbs
```

The `show dbs` command will display all your existing databases. Here, you have the admin, config, and local databases, which are empty initially. For details on the different functions that are available from the shell, type `help`. This will provide a list of some of the database methods available, including commands to display the database‚Äôs collections and information:

```
help
```
To check your container logs, you can use the docker logs command followed by the name of your container:

```
docker logs test-mongo --follow
```
