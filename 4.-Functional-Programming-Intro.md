# `Functional programming`

As on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming):


'In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.'


In this section We will pay more attention on some functions already supplied by python programming language to make our lives a bit easier. The things we are going to cover here are also useful for OOP paradigms as well. 

In Python in general everything is an **`object`**, thus functions do escape this either. Functions can be assigned to have other names etc.

```python
def say_hello() -> None:
  print("hello")

greet = say_hello

greet() # print 'hello'
```

So as you can se it behaves in the same fashion as some string or integer or any other object. To go even one step beyond we can do something like this:

```python
def say_hello() -> None:
  print("hello")

my_list = [1, say_hello, "something"]
for item in my_list:
  print(item)

# 1
# <function say_hello at 0x00000251F1AAF4C0>
# somethin
```


We can even take it one step further
```python
from collections.abc import Callable

def say_hello() -> None:
  print("hello")

def another_function(f: Callable) -> None:
  f()

another_function(say_hello)
```

Try to stop here and make sure we understand what is going on. Can someone from class explain it to the others?


When you pass a function to another function, the passed-in function sometimes is referred to as a **`callback`** because a call back to the inner function can modify the outer functionâ€™s behavior.


So it happens so that functions can also be arguments for other functions ðŸ¤¯ ! ! ! You will learn much more about this in the Decorator subject that are going to cover further in this course. But for now you can see that functions in python is pretty wide topic, there are plenty of possibilities here.


## sorted function

We have already seen this function in action in the beginning of the course.

```python
animals = ["ferret", "vole", "dog", "gecko"]
sorted(animals)
# ['dog', 'ferret', 'gecko', 'vole']
```

This is already something that we have seen, but sorted function [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) says that there might be another parameter passed into the function - key. _key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in iterable (for example, key=str.lower). The default value is None (compare the elements directly)._

So this key parameter accepts a callable and then tried to sort our data according to it:

```python
animals = ["ferret", "vole", "dog", "gecko"]
sorted(animals, key=len)
# ['dog', 'vole', 'gecko', 'ferret']
```

## Lambda functions


We have already had an intro to lambdas [here](https://github.com/CodeAcademy-Online/python-new-material/wiki/Lesson-11:-Functions-(-Part-2-))
Functional programming is all about calling functions and passing them around, so it naturally involves defining a lot of functions. You can always define a function in the usual way, using the [def](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/#function-calls-and-definition) keyword as you have seen in previous tutorials in this series.

Sometimes, though, itâ€™s convenient to be able to define an anonymous function on the fly, without having to give it a name. In Python, you can do this with a lambda expression.

for a reminder, The syntax of a lambda expression is as follows:

```python
lambda <parameter_list>: <expression>
```

| Column 1 Header | Column 2 Header |
| :--------------- | :--------------- |
| lambda | The keyword that introduces a lambda expression |
| <parameter_list> | An optional comma-separated list of parameter names |
| : | Punctuation that separates <parameter_list> from <expression> |
| expression| An expression usually involving the names inÂ <parameter_list> |

So let's continue now a bit on lambda functions.

```python

```
