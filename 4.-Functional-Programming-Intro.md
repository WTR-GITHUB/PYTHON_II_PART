# `Functional programming`

As on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming):


'In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.'


In this section We will pay more attention on some functions already supplied by python programming language to make our lives a bit easier. The things we are going to cover here are also useful for OOP paradigms as well. 

In Python in general everything is an **`object`**, thus functions do escape this either. Functions can be assigned to have other names etc.

```python
def say_hello() -> None:
  print("hello")

greet = say_hello

greet() # print 'hello'
```

So as you can se it behaves in the same fashion as some string or integer or any other object. To go even one step beyond we can do something like this:

```python
def say_hello() -> None:
  print("hello")

my_list = [1, say_hello, "something"]
for item in my_list:
  print(item)

# 1
# <function say_hello at 0x00000251F1AAF4C0>
# somethin
```


We can even take it one step further
```python
from collections.abc import Callable

def say_hello() -> None:
  print("hello")

def another_function(f: Callable) -> None:
  f()

another_function(say_hello)
```

So it happens so that functions can also be arguments for other functions ðŸ¤¯ ! ! ! You will learn much more about this in the Decorator subject that are going to cover further in this course. But for now you can see that functions in python is pretty wide topic, there are plenty of possibilities here.
