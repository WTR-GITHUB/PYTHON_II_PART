## Introduction
`MongoDB Schema Validation` is a feature that allows you to enforce structure and integrity rules on the documents stored in a MongoDB collection. It **enables you to define a set of validation rules that govern the structure and content of your data, ensuring that only valid and consistent documents are inserted or updated in the database**.

With schema validation, you can specify **rules for fields such as data types, value ranges, required fields, and more**. It helps maintain the data quality and consistency of your MongoDB collections, reducing the chances of storing invalid or inconsistent data.

The validation rules are defined using the `JSON schema` format, which is a standardized way of describing the structure and constraints of `JSON` documents. You can define these rules when creating or updating a collection, and MongoDB will automatically enforce them when performing write operations on the collection.

Schema validation in MongoDB can be used to enforce a wide range of constraints, including simple checks like data type validation, as well as complex rules involving relationships between fields and cross-field validation. This allows you to define custom rules that suit your specific data requirements.

By enforcing schema validation, you can improve the reliability and quality of your data, making it easier to work with and ensuring that it adheres to the desired structure. It provides an additional layer of data integrity within your MongoDB deployments and helps prevent data inconsistencies and errors.

It's worth noting that schema validation is an optional feature in MongoDB, and you can choose whether or not to enable it for your collections. When used appropriately, schema validation can be a powerful tool for maintaining the integrity and consistency of your MongoDB data.

## MongoDB Schema Validation Rules

- `Validator`: The validator defines the rules that documents must adhere to. It is specified as a dictionary within the `validation_rules` dictionary.

- `$jsonSchema`: The $jsonSchema key specifies the JSON schema syntax for defining the validation rules. It contains the main body of the validation 
   rules.

 - `bsonType`: The `bsonType` key specifies the expected data type for a field. It can be set to values such as string, `int`, double, array, object, and 
    more.

 - `required`: The required key specifies an array of field names that must be present in the document.

 - `properties`: The properties key defines the individual field validations within the document. Each field is specified as a key-value pair, where the 
    key is the field name and the value is the validation rule for that field.

 - `Additional Validation Rules`: Within the properties key, you can define additional validation rules for each field. For example, minimum and maximum 
    can be used to specify the range of values for a numeric field, and pattern can be used to enforce a specific format using regular expressions.

To enable schema validation for a collection, you can use the `collection.command('collMod', collection.name, validator=validation_rules)` method in `pymongo`. This command modifies the collection's options and sets the validation rules.

It's important to note that when using `pymongo`, if there is an **error during the validation rule setup, an exception will be raised, and you should handle it appropriately.**

Remember to adjust the validation rules, database, and collection names according to your specific requirements.

Example:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from pymongo.errors import OperationFailure

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['mydatabase']
collection = db['mycollection']

# Define the validation rules as a dictionary
validation_rules = {
    'validator': {
        '$jsonSchema': {
            'bsonType': 'object',
            'required': ['name', 'age', 'email'],
            'properties': {
                'name': {'bsonType': 'string'},
                'age': {'bsonType': 'int', 'minimum': 0},
                'email': {'bsonType': 'string', 'pattern': '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'}
            }
        }
    }
}

# Set the validation rules for the collection
try:
    collection.command('collMod', collection.name, validator=validation_rules)
    print("Schema validation enabled.")
except OperationFailure as e:
    print(f"Failed to enable schema validation: {e.details['errmsg']}")

# Clean up (optional)
client.close()

```

In this example, we first connect to the `MongoDB` server and select a database and collection. The validation rules are defined as a dictionary using the `JSON` schema syntax.

We then set the validation rules for the collection using the command method and the `collMod` command. The validator parameter is used to specify the validation rules dictionary. If an error occurs during the command execution, an `OperationFailure` exception is raised, and we extract and print the error message.

Finally, we close the `MongoDB` client connection. **It's important to close the connection to release resources properly.**

Make sure to replace `mongodb://localhost:27017/` with the appropriate MongoDB connection string for your environment, and adjust the database and collection names accordingly.

Another example: 

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['mydatabase']
collection = db['mycollection']

# Define the schema validation rules
validation_rules = {
    '$jsonSchema': {
        'bsonType': 'object',
        'required': ['name', 'age', 'email'],
        'properties': {
            'name': {
                'bsonType': 'string',
                'description': 'Name must be a string.'
            },
            'age': {
                'bsonType': 'int',
                'minimum': 0,
                'maximum': 120,
                'description': 'Age must be an integer between 0 and 120.'
            },
            'email': {
                'bsonType': 'string',
                'pattern': '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$',
                'description': 'Email must be a valid email address.'
            }
        }
    }
}

# Create the collection with schema validation
collection.create_index([('name', 1)], unique=True)  # Optional: Add unique index
collection.create_index(validation_rules, {'validator': {'$jsonSchema': validation_rules}})

# Insert a document that satisfies the validation rules
valid_doc = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'age': 30,
    'email': 'johndoe@example.com'
}
collection.insert_one(valid_doc)

# Insert a document that violates the validation rules
invalid_doc = {
    'name': 'Jane Smith',
    'age': '25',  # Invalid data type
    'email': 'janesmith'  # Invalid email format
}
try:
    collection.insert_one(invalid_doc)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to insert document: {e}")

# Retrieve all documents from the collection
documents = collection.find()
for doc in documents:
    print(doc)

# Clean up (optional)
collection.drop()

```

In this example, we first connect to the `MongoDB` server and create a database and a collection. We then define the schema validation rules using the `$jsonSchema` syntax. The validation rules specify that the document must have `name`, `age`, and `email` fields, with specific data types and constraints.

Next, we create the collection and specify the validation rules using the `create_index` method. We also add an optional unique index on the name field to enforce uniqueness.

We demonstrate the validation by inserting a valid document that satisfies the rules and an invalid document that violates the rules. When inserting the invalid document, an exception will be raised, and we catch and print the error message.

Finally, we retrieve and print all the documents from the collection. At the end, we drop the collection as a cleanup step.

**Make sure** to replace 'mongodb://localhost:27017/' with the appropriate MongoDB connection string for your environment.

### Multilevel document
Here's an example of setting validation rules for a MongoDB collection with multi-level documents using pymongo, including type returns and following good code practices:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from pymongo.errors import OperationFailure

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['mydatabase']
collection = db['mycollection']

# Define the validation rules as a dictionary
validation_rules = {
    'validator': {
        '$jsonSchema': {
            'bsonType': 'object',
            'required': ['name', 'age', 'contact'],
            'properties': {
                'name': {'bsonType': 'string'},
                'age': {'bsonType': 'int', 'minimum': 0},
                'contact': {
                    'bsonType': 'object',
                    'required': ['email', 'phone'],
                    'properties': {
                        'email': {'bsonType': 'string'},
                        'phone': {'bsonType': 'string', 'pattern': '^[0-9]{10}$'}
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

# Set the validation rules for the collection
try:
    collection.command('collMod', collection.name, validator=validation_rules)
    print("Schema validation enabled.")
except OperationFailure as e:
    print(f"Failed to enable schema validation: {e.details['errmsg']}")

# Clean up (optional)
client.close()

```
In this example, we connect to the MongoDB server and select a database and collection. The validation rules are defined as a dictionary using the JSON schema syntax.

The properties `key` within the validation rules dictionary is used to define the `validation rules` for each field. For a `multi-level` document, like in this example, you **can nest additional properties dictionaries to define the validation rules** for the nested fields.

In the given example, the validation rules expect that the document has a `name`, `age`, and `contact` field. The contact field is further specified to have an `email` and `phone` field, each with its own validation rules.

The rest of the code, including setting the validation `rules` and `error handling`, follows the same structure as the previous examples.

**Make sure** to replace `mongodb://localhost:27017/` with the appropriate MongoDB connection string for your environment, and adjust the database and collection names as needed.
