# Debugging Python code

There are a lot of ways one can Debug Python code. You could be using an IDE extensions allowing to do that in you IDE GUI, or you can do that a bit more tedious way with print statements or additional libraries.


## Good old print() statements

Of course by now we have used print plenty enough, some people also like to use print() for debugging or logging as well:

This is not great and not terrible during the developing period of your application, but once it is live - you should not be doing such things. So let's discuss other options.

P.S. If you got this far in course you know how print() works, so no examples here.

## pdb library:

Another a little bit more sophisticated way of debugging is using pdb library:

```python
...
import pdb
pdb.set_trace()
...
``` 

Once this line is reached you will get a shell where you can look around in computers memory and see what variables you have, their state etc.

Of course it is indeed a bit tedious to debug the code by writing more code... So let's look how we can do this with the help of the VSCode. 

So let's create main.py file and write some code:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

for item in my_list:
    something = item + 1
    print(something + 1)
```


So this is rather simple and straightforward but how do we inspect what is _something_ during the runtime? So let's at first one the left handside of the code window add red bubble simply by clicking with our cursor:

now we are ready for debugging. Hit the button with a play button and a bug:

For now simply choose _Python File: Debug the currently active Python file_ and this is it in a matter of seconds you will see something like this:

As you can see on the left hand side you can see all of the variables currently loaded into computers memory and you can inspect manually what is what. It is a bit less tedious approach cause now you have an UI where you can see things conveniently. What is more you have this play menu where you also have a few choices what to do.

Please have a go of your own. Write different code, try debugging it. Is everything clear? Discuss.

## Logging

So for now we have seen how to investigate
