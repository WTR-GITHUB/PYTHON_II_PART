## Dataclasses (Continue)

### Default values, `field`
 One of the useful features of dataclasses is the ability to define default values for attributes and fields.

Here is an example of defining default values for fields in a `dataclass`:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int = 18
    gender: str = 'male'

p1 = Person('John')
print(p1)  # Person(name='John', age=18, gender='male')

p2 = Person('Jane', 25, 'female')
print(p2)  # Person(name='Jane', age=25, gender='female')

```
In the above code, we defined a `Person` dataclass with three fields: `name`, `age`, and `gender`. The `age` and `gender` fields have default values of `18` and `male`, respectively. When we create a new instance of the `Person` class, we can provide values for the `name`, `age`, and `gender` fields. If we don't provide a value for age and gender, their default values will be used.

We can also specify **default values for fields using factory functions**. Here's an example:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

def get_default_age():
    return 18

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int = field(default_factory=get_default_age)
    gender: str = 'male'

p1 = Person('John')
print(p1)  # Person(name='John', age=18, gender='male')

p2 = Person('Jane', gender='female')
print(p2)  # Person(name='Jane', age=18, gender='female')

```
In this example, we define a `get_default_age()` function that returns the default `age` value of `18`. We use the `field()` function to specify the `default value` for the `age` **field**, passing in the `get_default_age()` function as the `default_factory` argument. When we create a new instance of the `Person` class, the `age` field will be initialized with the value returned by the `get_default_age()` function.

### Immutability

In Python, `dataclasses` are mutable **by default**, meaning that their attributes can be modified after the object is created. However, there may be cases where we want to create _immutable dataclasses_, which cannot be modified after they are created. Immutable dataclasses **can be useful in scenarios where we want to ensure that the state of an object cannot change**, such as when creating hashable objects or when working with concurrency. 

To create an immutable dataclass in Python, we can use the `frozen` parameter of the dataclass decorator. Here is an example:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int

```
In the above code, we define a `Person` dataclass with two fields: `name` and `age`. We set the `frozen` parameter of the dataclass decorator to `True`, which makes the `dataclass immutable`. Once a `Person` object is created,** its attributes cannot be modified**.

Here is an example of creating an immutable `Person` object:

```python
p = Person(name='John', age=30)
print(p)  # Person(name='John', age=30)

p.age = 40  # raises an AttributeError: can't set attribute

```
In the above code, we create a new `Person` object with a name of `John` and an age of `30`. When we try to modify the age attribute of the object, we get an `AttributeError` because the object is **immutable**.

It's worth noting that creating immutable dataclasses using the frozen parameter** has some limitations**. For example, if the dataclass contains mutable objects (such as lists or dictionaries), those objects can still be modified. In these cases, it's up to the developer to ensure that the dataclass is truly immutable.

## Exercises: 

* Task Nr.1:
 
  You have been asked to create a simple inventory management system for a small retail store. You need to define a `Product` class using the dataclass 
  module that represents a product in the store. Each `Product` should have a unique `ID`, a `name`, a `description`, a `price`, and a `quantity in 
  stock`. You also need to implement a method `calculate_total_cost` that calculates the total cost of a given number of items of the product, taking 
  into account any discounts that may apply.

* Task Nr.2:

  You need to create a program to manage a list of books in a library. Each book has a `title`, an `author`, a `publication year`, and an `ISBN`. You 
  need to define a `Book` class using the `dataclass` module that contains attributes for these properties. You also need to implement a `Library` class 
  that manages a list of books. The `Library` class should allow you to `add` and `remove` books from the library, search for books by `title` or 
  `author`, and display the list of books currently in the library.
