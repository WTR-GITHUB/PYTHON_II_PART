# `Functional programming`

As on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming):


'In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.'


In this section We will pay more attention on some functions already supplied by python programming language to make our lives a bit easier. The things we are going to cover here are also useful for OOP paradigms as well. 

In Python in general everything is an **`object`**, thus functions do escape this either. Functions can be assigned to have other names etc.

```python
def say_hello() -> None:
  print("hello")

greet = say_hello

greet() # print 'hello'
```

So as you can se it behaves in the same fashion as some string or integer or any other object. To go even one step beyond we can do something like this:

```python
def say_hello() -> None:
  print("hello")

my_list = [1, say_hello, "something"]
for item in my_list:
  print(item)

# 1
# <function say_hello at 0x00000251F1AAF4C0>
# somethin
```


We can even take it one step further
```python
from collections.abc import Callable

def say_hello() -> None:
  print("hello")

def another_function(f: Callable) -> None:
  f()

another_function(say_hello)
```

Try to stop here and make sure we understand what is going on. Can someone from class explain it to the others?

When you pass a function to another function, the passed-in function sometimes is referred to as a **`callback`** because a call back to the inner function can modify the outer function‚Äôs behavior.


So it happens so that functions can also be arguments for other functions ü§Ø ! ! ! You will learn much more about this in the Decorator subject that are going to cover further in this course. But for now you can see that functions in python is pretty wide topic, there are plenty of possibilities here.

But wait! There's more! as you can pass functions into another functions, functions can also return other functions!


```python
def outer():
    def inner():
        print("I am function inner()!")

    # Function outer() returns function inner()
    return inner


function = outer()
print(function)
# <function outer.<locals>.inner at 0x7f18bc85faf0>
function()
# I am function inner()!

outer()()
# I am function inner()!

```


## sorted function

We have already seen this function in action in the beginning of the course.

```python
animals = ["ferret", "vole", "dog", "gecko"]
sorted(animals)
# ['dog', 'ferret', 'gecko', 'vole']
```

This is already something that we have seen, but sorted function [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) says that there might be another parameter passed into the function - key. _key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in iterable (for example, key=str.lower). The default value is None (compare the elements directly)._

So this key parameter accepts a callable and then tried to sort our data according to it:

```python
animals = ["ferret", "vole", "dog", "gecko"]
sorted(animals, key=len)
# ['dog', 'vole', 'gecko', 'ferret']
```

# TODO exercises here


## Lambda functions


We have already had an intro to lambdas [here](https://github.com/CodeAcademy-Online/python-new-material/wiki/Lesson-11:-Functions-(-Part-2-))
Functional programming is all about calling functions and passing them around, so it naturally involves defining a lot of functions. You can always define a function in the usual way, using the [def](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/#function-calls-and-definition) keyword as you have seen in previous tutorials in this series.

Sometimes, though, it‚Äôs convenient to be able to define an anonymous function on the fly, without having to give it a name. In Python, you can do this with a lambda expression.

for a reminder, The syntax of a lambda expression is as follows:

```python
lambda <parameter_list>: <expression>
```

| Column 1 Header | Column 2 Header |
| :--------------- | :--------------- |
| lambda | The keyword that introduces a lambda expression |
| <parameter_list> | An optional comma-separated list of parameter names |
| : | Punctuation that separates <parameter_list> from <expression> |
| expression| An expression usually involving the names in¬†<parameter_list> |

So let's continue now a bit on lambda functions. Let's say we want to define lambda function that returns string in reverse:

```python
reverse = lambda s: s[::-1]
reverse("I am a string")
# 'gnirts a ma I'
```

This is actually the equivalent of:

```python
def reverse(s):
    return s[::-1]


reverse("I am a string")
# 'gnirts a ma I'


reverse = lambda s: s[::-1]
reverse("I am a string")
# 'gnirts a ma I'

```

As you can see they both yield the same result.
What is more as you have already seen it is not necessary to assign lambda function a name, you can also call it directly:

```python
(lambda s: s[::-1])("I am a string")
# 'gnirts a ma I'
```

One more example:

```python
(lambda x1, x2, x3: (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3)(9, 6, 6)
# 7.0
(lambda x1, x2, x3: (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3)(1.4, 1.1, 0.5)
# 1.0
```

Is it clear what is happening here? can anyone in the class explain the code?


Now let's go back into the `sorted` function we have seen already. since lambda gives us `callable`:

```python
callable(lambda s: s[::-1])
# True
```

**NOTE** ‚ùó  callable: Return `True` if the object argument appears callable, `False` if not.


# reviewing our code from before:
```python
animals = ["ferret", "vole", "dog", "gecko"]

def reverse_len(string: str) -> int:
    return -len(string)

sorted(animals, key=reverse_len)
# ['ferret', 'gecko', 'vole', 'dog']
```

This could be changed with lambda function:

```python
animals = ["ferret", "vole", "dog", "gecko"]
sorted(animals, key=lambda s: -len(s))
# ['ferret', 'gecko', 'vole', 'dog']
```


Looks a little bit more compact and is still quite readable right? As any things in programming or life both approaches have up and down sides. Discuss the advantages and disadvanates of both approaches.



**NOTE** ‚ùó  you can only define fairly rudimentary functions with lambda. The return value from a lambda expression can only be one single expression. A lambda expression can‚Äôt contain statements like assignment or return, nor can it contain control structures such as for, while, if, else, or def.

As we have seen before functions in python can return anything:

```python
def func(x):
    return x, x ** 2, x ** 3

func(2)
# (2, 4, 16)
```

In this case we simply return Tuple. Does anyone remember what Tuple is? what are the specifics?
Let's say we try to do the same with lambda functions:

```python
(lambda x: x, x ** 2, x ** 3)(3)
<stdin>:1: SyntaxWarning: 'tuple' object is not callable; perhaps you missed a comma?
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

To work with this is all you got to do is explicitly tell python that this is a Tuple object that we are returning:

```python
(lambda x: (x, x ** 2, x ** 3))(3)
# (3, 9, 27)
(lambda x: [x, x ** 2, x ** 3])(3)
# [3, 9, 27]
(lambda x: {1: x, 2: x ** 2, 3: x ** 3})(3)
# {1: 3, 2: 9, 3: 27}
```

As you can see there might be plenty of variations of what **lambda functions** can return.


One more final detail: If you find a need to include a lambda expression in a formatted string literal (f-string), then you‚Äôll need to enclose it in explicit parentheses:

```python
print(f"--- {lambda s: s[::-1]} ---")
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    (lambda s)
             ^
SyntaxError: f-string: invalid syntax
```

Do this instead:
```python
print(f"--- {(lambda s: s[::-1])} ---")
# --- <function <lambda> at 0x7f97b775fa60> ---
print(f"--- {(lambda s: s[::-1])('I am a string')} ---")
# --- gnirts a ma I ---
```

# Map function

The first function on the docket is map(), which is a Python built-in function. With map(), you can apply a function to each element in an iterable in turn, and map() will return an iterator that yields the results. This can allow for some very concise code because a map() statement can often take the place of an explicit loop.

Syntax:

```python
map(<f>, <iterable>)
```

Let's revisit our function:
```python
def reverse(s):
    return s[::-1]

reverse("I am a string")
```

If you have a list of strings, then you can use map() to apply reverse() to each element of the list:


```python
animals = ["cat", "dog", "hedgehog", "gecko"]
iterator = map(reverse, animals)
iterator
# <map object at 0x7fd3558cbef0>
```


**NOTE** ‚ùó ‚ùó ‚ùó But remember, map() doesn‚Äôt return a list. It returns an iterator called a map object. To obtain the values from the iterator, you need to either iterate over it or use list():

```python
animals = ["cat", "dog", "hedgehog", "gecko"]
def reverse(s):
    return s[::-1]

iterator = map(reverse, animals)
for i in iterator:
    print(i)
# tac
# god
# gohegdeh
# okceg

iterator = map(reverse, animals)
list(iterator)

```


Let's take it further once more, we already know that lambdas give us a function, let's try passing it to map function:

```python
animals = ["cat", "dog", "hedgehog", "gecko"]
iterator = map(lambda s: s[::-1], animals)
list(iterator)
# ['tac', 'god', 'gohegdeh', 'okceg']
```

Let's even do it a more compact way:

```python
list(map(lambda s: s[::-1], ["cat", "dog", "hedgehog", "gecko"]))
# ['tac', 'god', 'gohegdeh', 'okceg']
```

If the iterable contains something that is not suitable for a certain operation:

```python
list(map(lambda s: s[::-1], ["cat", "dog", 3.14159, "gecko"]))
"""Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <lambda>
TypeError: 'float' object is not subscriptable
"""
```
