## Method Chaining 

Method chaining is a technique in which _multiple method calls are chained together_ in a **single statement**, using the output of one method as the input for the next method. This can make code more concise and readable, as well as making it easy to chain together operations that need to be performed on an object.

Here's an example of method chaining in Python:

```python
class MyString:
    def __init__(self, value: str):
        self.value = value

    def add_exclamation(self) -> 'MyString':
        self.value += "!"
        return self

    def make_upper(self) -> 'MyString':
        self.value = self.value.upper()
        return self

my_string = MyString("hello")
my_string.add_exclamation().make_upper()

print(my_string.value) # output: "HELLO!"

```
In this example, we have a `MyString` class with two methods: `add_exclamation` and `make_upper`. Both of these methods return `self`, which allows us to chain the calls together. The `add_exclamation` method modifies the value of the `MyString` object by adding an exclamation point to it, and the `make_upper` method modifies the value by converting it to upper case.

We create an instance of `MyString` with the value `hello`, and then call `add_exclamation` and `make_upper` on it in one statement. This results in the value of the `MyString` object being modified to `HELLO!`.
Another example:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.address = None
    
    def set_name(self, name: str) -> 'Person':
        self.name = name
        return self

    def set_age(self, age: int) -> 'Person':
        self.age = age
        return self
    
    def set_address(self, address: str) -> 'Person':
        self.address = address
        return self
    
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f'{self.name}, {self.age}, {self.address}'

p = Person("John", 25)
p.set_address("123 Main St").set_age(26)

print(p) # output: "John, 26, 123 Main St"

```
In this example, we have a `Person` class that has three methods: `set_name`, `set_age`, and `set_address`. Each of these methods sets a different attribute of the `Person` object and return the **instance itself**. In the last lines of code, we can see how to chain the method calls by using the `return` statement.

We create an instance of `Person` with the name `John` and the age `25`, then we chain two method calls `set_address` and `set_age` in a single statement, which set the address attribute to `123 Main St` and the age attribute to `26`, respectively.

Notice the `__str__` (upcoming lecture - magic methods) method that allows us to print the person object in a readable format, it's optional but it makes it easy to see the state of the class.

This example demonstrate how we can use_ method chaining_ to set multiple attributes of an object in a single, concise statement, making the code more readable and easy to understand.

## super() function

In Python, the `super()` function is used **to call a method from a parent class**. This is particularly useful in cases where you are creating a subclass and want to override a method of the parent class, but still want to use the functionality of the original method in some way.

Here is an example of using the super() function to call a method from a parent class:

```python
class Parent:
    def greet(self) -> None:
        print("Hello from Parent class")

class Child(Parent):
    def greet(self) -> None:
        super().greet()
        print("Hello from Child class")

c = Child()
c.greet()
# output: 
# "Hello from Parent class"
# "Hello from Child class"
```

In this example, we have a `Parent` class with a `greet` method that simply prints "Hello from Parent class". The `Child` class inherits from the `Parent` class, and also has its own implementation of the `greet` method.

The `Child` class's greet method uses the `super()` function to call the `greet` method of its parent class, `Parent`. It then prints "Hello from Child class" after that.

So, the `super()` function here is used to call the `greet` method of the parent class, allowing the child class to inherit the functionality of the parent class's method, and also add its own functionality.

Here's another example:

```python
class A:
    def __init__(self, value: int) -> None:
        self.value = value
        
    def increment(self) -> None:
        self.value += 1

class B(A):
    def __init__(self, value: int, step: int) -> None:
        super().__init__(value)
        self.step = step
        
    def increment(self) -> None:
        super().increment()
        self.value += self.step

b = B(5, 3)
b.increment()
print(b.value) # output: 8

```
In this example, we have two classes: `A` and `B`. `A` has an `__init__` method, which accepts a value parameter and assigns it to the value attribute. It also has a increment method which increases the value attribute by one.

`B` is a subclass of `A`, it inherits `A's` functionality and also has its own functionality. `B` has an additional step attribute, that it takes as a parameter in its `init` method, it also has its own implementation of increment method that calls the increment method of the superclass using `super().increment()` and increases the value attribute by step.

When we create an instance of `B` and call the increment method, it first calls the parent's increment method which increases the value attribute by one and then increments it by step.

It's important to note that when the `super()` method is called, it returns a temporary object of the superclass, which allows you to call its methods.

The `super()` function is particularly useful when working with_ multiple inheritance_, and helps to avoid naming conflicts between methods in different parent classes.
